	<h1>Python 1</h1>
	<p>Program Terms:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Function- a type of procedure or routine that carries out a task.</li>
	<li>Argument-a value that is passed to a function.</li>
	<li>String-a data type which is a sequence of characters. </li>
	<li>Variable-a container, given a name, that represents a value.</li>
	<li>Integer- a whole number.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>It is important to keep track of data types so one doesn't use a function on 
	a type that is not valid. It is also helpful to keep track data types so that one is 
	able to preform the operation one desires. For example you want to add to integers 
	rather than concatenate two stings.</p>
