	        <h2>Solution: Portable Computer Labs</h2>
	        <br><br>
	        <p>
	            To increase the student's access to computers while keeping the overall cost low, we propose implementing
	            portable computer labs. These labs would consist of a cart on wheels housing 
	            computers for one class size.The computers used would be Chromebooks due to their light weight, 
	            small size (11in screen), and low cost for schools. The Chromebooks would also be able to be
	            charged in the cart so that once a class finishes using them, another class can utilize the
	            computers without worrying about how much charge the laptops have.

                 Additionally, we also propose a software that allows students to connect to the 
                 classroom materials from any device that can access the internet.
                 This means that even if there were not enough Chromebooks in one portable
                 computer lab, students would still be able to follow along using their
                 smartphones.
