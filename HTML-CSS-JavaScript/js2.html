	<h2> JavaScript Questions </h2>
	<ul>
	<li>When someone is searching an object but the object they are searching may
	or may not be in the computer. For example if someone was searching for a student in 
	a class but they did not know if the student was in the class they were searching
	in. </li>
	<li>If the picture was not called in the src as the image it was titled in the image 
	file, there would be an error and the image that would display would not be a the 
	lightbulb but the image with the same name as the one called in the src. 
	</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<script>
	function changeImage() { 
	var image = document.getElementById('myImage');

		image.src = "images/bulboff.png";
	} else {
		image.src = "images/bulbon.png";
		}
	}
	
	function checkNumber(){ 
	var x, text; 
	x = document.getElementById("num").value; 
	if (isNaN(x) || x < 1 || x > 10) {
